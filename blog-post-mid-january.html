        <p>Happy New Year! 2017 has been off to such a busy start. I am so incredibly pleased with the outcome of my Genius Hour project, which essentially wrapped up with the new year. I have been working with the town historical society, in an effort to integrate useful technologies, such as Google Drive, and to make advances in their web presence. There were successes and failures here, but I truly believe that it was a very productive learning experience, which I will not forget. We have also been going out on a number of schooldudes, trying to take care of these issues, as quickly as possible. Luckily, there have not been a significant quantity of incidents recently, simply ones that are quite unique. This includes kernel panics, network issues, and a recording issue, in the foreign language lab. These issues, if not already resolved, will be very soon and Josh and I have certainly had a chance to learn a bit from them. And lastly, just taking a look at semester 1, in review, we have had the opportunity to explore quite a few interesting areas, ranging from VR, to new tech tools, to the work we have done on our genius hour project. I think one of the most interesting experiences I got to have was assisting the Chinese exchange students’ teacher in setting up a laptop in Mandarin Chinese (a language I do not take). It was so interesting to see how somebody from another culture interacts with technology. I really believe that learning about how people are using technology is just as important as the time we spend finding new technology or fixing current technology, at the help desk. I’m looking forward to continuing, on help desk, into the 2nd semester, and all the new experiences, which will come with it!</p>
