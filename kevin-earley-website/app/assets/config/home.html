                  <p>Kevin Earley is a Junior at Sharon High School and currently a member of the SHS Tech Help Desk program. Kevin enjoys  being given a chance to help troubleshoot many common technical issues, especially  in an organization with so many moving parts. Outside of the program, Kevin is just as interested in technology, being proficient in several web development languages as well as the command line. He also enjoys being a part of the Sharon High School Theatre Company props team, several school choirs, playing guitar (you don’t have to be good at playing guitar to enjoy it...), drawing cartoons, and being a board member of the Sharon Historical Society. He looks forward to what he will learn as part of the “Help Desk”.</p>
